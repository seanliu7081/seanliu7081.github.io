# About me

Iâ€™m a junior-year undergraduate student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, majoring in Robotic Engineering and minoring in Mathematics. Currently, I am a research intern in [The Helping Hands Lab](https://www2.ccs.neu.edu/research/helpinghands/) at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/), advised by Professor [Robert Platt](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/people/robert-platt/).

# Research Vision

My long-term research vision is to build automation systems that can be self-adaptive to new environments based on trustworthy data input from perception and learn motion strategies from logistics reasoning. These systems will assist humans to accomplish challenging tasks in the physical world.
