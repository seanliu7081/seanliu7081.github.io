I am a junior-year undergraduate student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, majoring in Robotics Engineering with a minor in Mathematics. Currently, I am a research intern at [The Helping Hands Lab](https://www2.ccs.neu.edu/research/helpinghands/) at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/), advised by Professor [Robert Platt](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/people/robert-platt/).

## News

- **August 10, 2024:** I have extended my research internship at Northeastern University through November 11, 2025.
- **June 30, 2024:** Our paper, "Loss Distillation via Gradient Matching for Point Cloud Completion with Weighted Chamfer Distance," has been accepted for an **Oral Presentation** at IEEE/RSJ IROS 2024.
- **May 1, 2024:** This summer, I will join The Helping Hands Lab at Northeastern University as a research intern to work on cutting-edge robotic projects focusing on manipulations and 3D vision. Our projects will collaborate closely with Boston Dynamic AI to tackle critical challenges in robotics.
- **January 31, 2024:** Our paper, "Vision-based FDM Printing for Fabricating Airtight Soft Actuators," has been accepted for an **Oral Presentation** at IEEE RoboSoft 2024.

## Research Vision

My long-term research vision is to develop automation systems that are self-adaptive to new environments based on trustworthy data input from perception and learning motion strategies from logistics reasoning. These systems will assist humans in accomplishing challenging tasks in the physical world.
