Iâ€™m a junior-year undergraduate student at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, majoring in Robotic Engineering and minoring in Mathematics. Currently, I am a research intern in [The Helping Hands Lab](https://www2.ccs.neu.edu/research/helpinghands/) at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/), advised by Professor [Robert Platt](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/people/robert-platt/).

# News

- 8/10/2024 I extend my research internship at Northeastern University to 8/11/2025.
- 6/30/2024 Our paper: *Loss Distillation via Gradient Matching for Point Cloud Completion with Weighted Chamfer Distance* has been accepted by **IEEE/RSJ IROS 2024** as an **Oral Presentation**!
- 5/1/2024 This summer, I will join The Helping Hands Lab at Northeastern University as a research intern to work on cutting-edge robotic projects focusing on manipulations and 3D vision. Our projects will deeply cooperate with Bostn Dynamic AI to address critical challenges in robotics.
- 1/31/2024 Our paper: *Vision-based FDM Printing for Fabricating Airtight Soft Actuators* has been accepted by **IEEE RoboSoft 2024** as an **Oral Presentation**!

# Research Vision

My long-term research vision is to build automation systems that can be self-adaptive to new environments based on trustworthy data input from perception and learn motion strategies from logistics reasoning. These systems will assist humans to accomplish challenging tasks in the physical world.
